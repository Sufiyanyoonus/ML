Unsupervised Learning Assessment: Clustering with the Iris Dataset
Objective
The objective of this assessment was to evaluate the understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset, specifically the Iris dataset.

1. Loading and Preprocessing
Loaded the Iris dataset from the sklearn library.
Dropped the species column since this is a clustering problem.
Performed data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for clustering:
Handled null values.
Scaled the data for better clustering performance.
2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset from 4 dimensions to 2 dimensions.
This step was crucial for visualization purposes, making it easier to see the clustering results in a 2D space.
3. KMeans Clustering
Determined the optimal number of clusters (k) using methods like the Elbow method and Silhouette score.
Implemented KMeans clustering with the optimal k value.
Visualized the clusters in the PCA-reduced space.
Calculated the inertia to evaluate how well the clusters were formed, with a value of 144 noted.
Evaluated the quality of clustering using the Silhouette score, which was found to be 0.55.
4. Hierarchical Clustering
Provided a brief description of how Hierarchical Clustering works and why it is suitable for the Iris dataset.
Applied Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to the PCA-reduced dataset.
Created a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchical relationships between data points.
Observed clusters from the dendrogram and plotted the results to visualize the clusters.
5. Visualization
Created visualizations for both KMeans and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, showcasing how the clusters were formed.
Used distinct colors to differentiate the clusters.
6. Conclusion
Summarized the findings from KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering.
Discussed the strengths and weaknesses of both clustering methods applied to the Iris dataset.
